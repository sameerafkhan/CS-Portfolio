•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories are interpreted during the planning and analysis phase. Key stakeholders will provide insight and information on issues with the existing system. Surveys can also help with finding the user needs.
The use story document is created to document the user needs from the end-user perspective. The user story will help developers understand the features they need to add/amend to an application.

•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The approach to developing a program is understanding the domain, the key business objectives, and the goal.
The agile process incorporates flexibility, collaboration, continuous integration, and continuous development. 
Agile methodology provides flexibility to change and add new user stories to the product backlog. 
Team collaboration through scrum ceremonies.
CI/CD by following agile-scrum principles to deliver product features incrementally.

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good software development team member is ready to adapt to changes, is open to communication, has problem-solving skills, and should be a team player.
